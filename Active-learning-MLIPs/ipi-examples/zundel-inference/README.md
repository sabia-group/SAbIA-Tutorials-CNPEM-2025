# Zundel cation

Here is a description of the files that you will find in this folder:

---

## Input files

- `input.xml`: input configuration file for i-PI specifying the simulation parameters and system setup.

- `start.extxyz`: initial atomic structure used to start the simulation or model drivers.

- `mace.com=0_compiled.model` to `mace.com=3_compiled.model`: precompiled MACE machine learning models used by each driver to predict forces.

---

## Output files

- `ipi.log`: log file generated by i-PI during the simulation. Contains runtime messages and diagnostics.

- `ipi.mace_force_0.extxyz` to `ipi.mace_force_3.extxyz`: force predictions from each individual MACE committee member (drivers 0 through 3).

- `ipi.mean_force_0.xyz`: averaged forces or structure trajectory obtained by aggregating predictions from the committee.

- `ipi.mean_properties.out`: properties output from the simulation.

- `ipi.mace_properties`: potential energy computed by each committee member.

- `ipi.pos_0.extxyz`: position trajectory file containing the atomic configurations sampled during the simulation.

- `RESTART`: file used by i-PI to store the simulation state for restarting or continuing from a checkpoint.


---

## Scripts

- `run.sh`: shell script to launch the i-PI server and multiple MACE driver instances.

- `clean.sh`: utility script to clean generated output files and reset the folder.

---

This folder contains all necessary inputs, models, and scripts to run i-PI molecular dynamics simulations of the Zundel cation with a MACE committee force field. The outputs include trajectories, force predictions, and log files for analysis.
